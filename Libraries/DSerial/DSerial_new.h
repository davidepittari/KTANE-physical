/** @file dserial.h
 *  @brief Headers and definitions for the DSerial Library
 *
 *  The DSerial library adds a layer-3/4 interface intended to be used on top
 *  of a serial UART multi-drop bus. DSerial adds addressing and message 
 *  acknowledgment in a master/client configuration. Clients are polled for
 *  data. 
 *
 *  The library is divided into Master and Client classes. In order for constant
 *  data flow, all communicating parties should call "doSerial" often. Functions
 *  in the DSerial library do not block and all but getClients should be
 *  execute relatively quickly.
 *
 *  Currently, only bytes with values between 1 and 255 inclusive are allowed
 *  support for sending 0's is hopefully coming soon.
 *
 *  Definitions:
 *    - Packet: Data in the form of {START}{MESSAGE}{PARITY}{END}
 *      - Currently, the first byte of the message is the client address
 *    - Valid addresses for clients are between 1 and MAX_CLIENTS
 *      - MAX_CLIENTS can be at most 126.
 *
 *  The overall interaction method with this library should be through the 
 *  sendData and getData methods on the master and client objects. Unlike the
 *  notion of a message used internally, these strings do not contain the id
 *  of the intended recipient.
 *
 *  (Internally however, a "message" always contains the destination client id
 *   as the first byte)
 *
 *  At because it is impossible to know which client a corrupted packet was
 *  intended for, clients to not NAK corrupt packets, instead the transaction
 *  will just time out and the master node will retry the transaction. This 
 *  takes longer, but because the whole library is non-blocking it's fine.
 *
 *  Future improvements:
 *    - Switch to all length based binary processing to allow nulls
 *    - Have the client address be broken out into the packet datatype.
 *
 *  Current transaction structure:
 *    Client -> Master:
 *      1 M: {READ}
 *      2 C: {DATA}
 *      3 M: {ACK}
 *      4 C: {ACK}
 *    
 *    Client -> Master (If no data):
 *      1 M: {READ}
 *      2 C: {ACK}
 *    
 *    Master -> Client:
 *      1 M: {WRITE}{DATA}
 *      2 C: {ACK}
